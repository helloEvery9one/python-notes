# variables are names that we assign to a value
one_hundred = 100
print(one_hundred)

# constants - variables that never change
# to indicate that a variable is a constant, use all caps when naming
# ex: PI = 3.14

# __ (double underscore) - dunder
# don't create variables with double underscore

# shorthand way to assign variables:
# a,b,c = 1,2,3

#--------------------------variable rules------------------------------
# 1. has to be snake_case
# 2. can only start with a letter or underscore
# 3. contains letters, numbers, underscores
# 4. case sensitive
# 5. don't overwrite keywords such as int

#--------------------expressions vs statements-------------------------
# expressions - a = 12 + 3 (12 + 3 is an expression)
# statements - a = 12 + 3 (entire line is a statement)

#------------------augmented assignment operators----------------------
# five = 5
# five += 5 (same as five = five + 5)
# five -= 5 (same as five = five - 5)
# five *= 5 (same as five = five * 5)
