# fundamental data types:
# int - integer
# float
# bool - boolean
# str - string
# list
# tuple
# set
# dict

# classes - custom types
# ex: MyCars

# specialized data types:
# modules
# None

# other data types:
# complex
# bin - binary


# --------------------------DEVELOPER TIPS:-----------------------------
# 1. don't read the python dictionary, as it is not needed to remember everything.

# 2. make descriptive variables. your code should read like English.

# 3. comments are a way to provide information/clarification on a piece of code.
# make good use of them so you don't add clutter to your code.

# 4. understand the different types of data structures. some data structures
# are useful in different situations.

# 5. when you don't use the variable in a for loop, name the variable '_'.
# this tells other programmers that the variable is not going to be used.

# 6. programmers should write good code. this means code should be clean, readable,
# predictable, and should not have any repeats.

# 7. when writing functions, it should do 2 things. the first thing is that it should
# do one thing really well. the second is that it should return something.

# 8. 'clean up' your code so other devs can understand your code without
# having too much clutter.

# 9. test your understanding. good programmers test their understanding
# to grasp the concept of something better.
